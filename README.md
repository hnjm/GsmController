# GSM Controller
A time has come to bring to life GSM module, which will replace my old GSM dialer. The dialer was a nice device for controlling burglary alarm and a remote for Access Control System. But dialer finally died.  
So I wired my Rasperry Pi to the module, bought SIM card and started to play with the module. It took a while until I configured module for use.  
After this I wrote an app able to communicate with the module over serial interface.  
The next will come an api to allow using it in home automation system.
